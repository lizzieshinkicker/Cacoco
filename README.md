# Description
Cacoco is an editor for SBARDEF files, and hopefully soon other ID24 features.

There's a lot of good features, but I'm kinda tired and I'll write a lot more later when this is a bit more public.

You're going to need to use an SBARDEF compliant sourceport like the dev builds of [Helion](https://github.com/Helion-Engine/Helion) or [Woof](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof).

Build it in the same way you build a rust application in your environment of choice, or [I have a Windows precompiled release available](https://github.com/lizzieshinkicker/cacoco/releases).

...Yeah, I'll write a better landing page soon, I promise! ^^;;

Thank you to [NightFright's great work on their SBARDEF mod for Woof for inspiration](https://github.com/NightFright2k19/doom_sbardef), and many many others to help crack the spec sheet. I hope this tool makes development easier.
